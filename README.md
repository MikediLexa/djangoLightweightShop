# djangoLightwieghtShop -- Codealong
 
 I tried the YT-Tutorial by freecodecamp & code with stein
 Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxMB6Njs3ck
 
 Basics:
 
 - Created four apps: core, item, dashboard, conversation
 - takeaways:
  - interaction between apps in django by urls.py
  - CRUD with models.py, forms.py
  - handling model-data in html-files
  
  
The most stupid mistake: writing converstations instead of conversations

Run through the tutorial in 6 hours.
